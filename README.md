# LowMC_2diff

This is the code for experiments of attack on toy LowMC with a full S-box layer when considering 2-difference.

1. `guess_time_2diff.cpp`, `LowMC_2diff.cpp`, `LowMC_2diff.h`

They are the code for the experiments.


2. `constantFull`

It contains the constants used in our LowMC encription.


3. `linearFull`

It contains the matrices used in the liear layer in our LowMC encription.


4. `keyFull`

It contains the matrices used to generate round keys in our LowMC encription.


5. `inverseFull`

It contains the matrices used in the linear layer in our LowMC decription.

6. `exp1`, `exp2`, `exp3`

They contain some results of experiments.
